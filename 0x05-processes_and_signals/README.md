In computing, processes and signals are fundamental concepts that govern the behavior and communication within operating systems. A process is an instance of a running program, comprising executable code, memory, and resources. Processes can communicate and synchronize with each other through signals, which are software interrupts used to notify a process of events or to request specific actions. Understanding processes and signals is essential for efficient multitasking, inter-process communication, and managing system resources in modern computing environments.
